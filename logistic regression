Brief Note on Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems, where the
output has only two possible classes (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1, Buy/Not Buy).

Instead of predicting continuous values, logistic regression predicts probabilities using the sigmoid function,
which maps any real value between 0 and 1.

The decision boundary is set using a threshold (usually 0.5). If probability ≥ 0.5 → class 1, else class 0.
It uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to find the best-fitting model.

Advantages:

Simple, fast, and easy to interpret

Works well for linearly separable data

Gives probabilistic outcomes

Applications:
