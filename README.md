Concept Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. 
It predicts probabilities using the sigmoid function, which maps values between 0 and 1. A threshold (usually 0.5) is applied to convert probability into class labels. It uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation to fit the model. Part 2 – Logistic Regression
Using Python Steps Performed: Loaded advertising.csv using Pandas Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Generated heatmap, distribution plots, and sigmoid function Trained Logistic
Regression using Scikit-Learn Evaluated the model using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy
Evaluation Metrics (Sample Output) Precision: 0.94 Recall: 0.92 F1 Score: 0.93 Accuracy: 0.96 Conclusion The Logistic Regression model performed well with high precision, recall, and overall accuracy. It is suitable for binary classification tasks such as predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement.
